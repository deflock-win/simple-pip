## Requirements

* Windows Vista or newer
* Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7 or newer

## How to get

* Application is single-exe file and portable. No setup step is required.
* Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/deflock-win/simple-pip/releases). 
* Download `simple-pip.exe` and place it anywhere you want.

## How to use

* Launch `simple-pip.exe`. You might create a shortcut on desktop for it.
* An empty form and tray icon of the application will be shown.
* Right-click on either form or tray icon and you'll see a list of all your available windows.
* Every window is identified by its title and optional icon.
* Find the window you want to be always-on-top and left-click on it.
* The form now contains the required window and it's auto-sized.

## What you can do

* Resize the form and window thumbnail will be resized automatically. If the thumbnail doesn't fit the form then right-click on the form/tray icon and select `Resize`.
* Single left-click on the form will bring the required window to the front. So if you want to fast-switch to that window then just left-click on the thumbnail.
* To drag the form you don't need a title bar. Use any position on form/thumbnail for this.
